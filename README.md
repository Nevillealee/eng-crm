This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

*On the first run you will need to
1. Install the dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Generate the Prisma Client by running `npx prisma generate`
3. Migrate the database by running `npx prisma migrate dev` (you can also use `npx prisma db push` if you don't want to create a migration file)


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
